# Account deprecated

This profile was used for a previous employer.

GitHub [recommends using a single account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-personal-account/merging-multiple-personal-accounts) to manage both personal and professional repositories. As such, this account is no longer being updated in favor of my personal GitHub.

## Current GitHub Account

Current work can be found at [https://github.com/JonathanCrider](https://github.com/JonathanCrider)
